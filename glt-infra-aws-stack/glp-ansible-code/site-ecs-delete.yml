# NOTE:
#   Domain names
#     - Applications ( UI and Backend ) register CNAMES with route53 when deployed
#       and destroyed
#     - The domain name is passed via terraform
#     - Domain name is not needed for update operations and hence can be integrated
#       with CI without that value
#     - A default value for domain is also set in group_vars/all in case services
#       are deployed/erased manually

# Delete route53 private_zone entries.
# As these entires are not deleted by terraform it cannot
# destroy the private zone if these are not deleted
